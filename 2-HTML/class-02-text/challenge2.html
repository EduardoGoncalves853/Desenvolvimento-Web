            Had to have high, high hopes for a living<br>
        Shooting for the stars when I couldn't make a killing<br>
        Didn't have a dime, but I always had a vision<br>
        Always had high, high hopes<br>
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Had to have high, high hopes for a living<br>
        Didn't know how, but I always had a feeling<br>
        I was gonna be that one in a million<br>
        Always had high, high hopes<br>

        Mama said: Fulfill the prophecy<br>
        Be something greater, go make a legacy<br>
        Manifest destiny, back in the days<br>
        We wanted everything, wanted everything<br>
        <p>
        Mama said: Burn your biographies<br>
        Rewrite your history, light up your wildest dreams<br>
        Museum victories, everyday<br>
        We wanted everything, wanted everything<br>
        <p>
        Mama said: Don't give up<br>
        It's a little complicated<br>
        All tied up, no more love<br>
        And I'd hate to see you waiting<br>

        Mama said: It's uphill for oddities<br>
        The stranger crusaders ain't ever wannabes<br>
        The weird and the novelties don't ever change<br>
        We wanted everything, wanted everything<br>
        <p>
        Stay up on that rise, stay up on that rise<br>
        And never come down, oh<br>
        Stay up on that rise, stay up on that rise<br>
        And never come down<br>
        <p>

        They say it's all been done<br>
        But they haven't seen the best of me, eh, eh, eh<br>
        So I got one more run<br>
        And it's gonna be a sight to see, eh, eh, eh<br>
