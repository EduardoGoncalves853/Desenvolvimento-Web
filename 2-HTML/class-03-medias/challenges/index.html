<h2>parte 1</h2>
<p>
  Had to have high, high hopes for a living<br>
  Shooting for the stars when I couldn't make a killing<br>
  Didn't have a dime, but I always had a vision<br>
  Always had high, high hopes<br>

  <p>Mama said: It's uphill for oddities<br>
      The stranger crusaders ain't ever wannabes<br>
      The weird and the novelties don't ever change<br>
      We wanted everything, wanted everything<br>
